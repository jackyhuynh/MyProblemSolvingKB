# Collection of Software Development using Python
 
## Introduction:
- Include program challanges, and projects that I solved at [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/), [AI Academy](https://ai-academy.com/), and 100 days of Code Challanges from Problems Solving, Algorithm, Automation, Games, Web Scrapping, Console Applications, PC Applications, and Web Applications. The projects range from beginner, intermediate, and advance level. They was code in Python using Jupiter Notebook or PyCharm
- This directory is used as my library to search for projects that I solved. Each folder contain the specific requirements to run app
## Source:

- Majority of the projects in this directory introduce by [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). Please Take a look at Angela's courses if you are interested in learning Python. It is really good for some one just start or simply want to consolidate your knowledge
- The other code challenges was from [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [AI Academy](https://ai-academy.com/)
