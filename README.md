- Majority of the projects in this directory introduce by [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). Please Take a look at Angela's courses if you are interested in learning Python. It is really good for some one just start or simply want to consolidate your knowledge
- The other code challenges was from [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [AI Academy](https://ai-academy.com/)
