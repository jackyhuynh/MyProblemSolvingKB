# Collection of Coding Challanges using Python
 
## Introduction:
- Include program challanges, and projects that I solved at Hacker Rank, AI Foundation, and 100 days of Code Challanges from Problems Solving, Algorithm, Automation, Games, Web Scrapping, Console Applications, PC Applications, and Web Applications. The projects range from beginner, intermediate, and advance level. They was code in Python using Jupiter Notebook or PyCharm
- This directory is used as my library to search for projects that I solved. Each folder contain the specific requirements to run app

## Technology
List of technology: Python, Object Oriented Design, Full Stack Web Applications, Desktop Applications, Console Applications, Web Scrapping, UI/UX Design, Computer Graphic, Data Sciences

## Lesson:

### Section 66: Build Rest API
#### Turn SQLAlchemy Object into a JSO
- Normally, we've been returning HTML templates using render_template(), but this time, because our server is now acting as an API, we want to return a JSON containing the necessary data. Just like real public APIs.
- e.g. ISS API: http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json
- turn our the SQLAlchemy Object into a JSON. This process is called serialization.

#### Methods:
- Flask has a serialisation helper method built-in called [jsonify()](https://www.kite.com/python/docs/flask.jsonify) . But we have to provide the structure of the JSON to return.

- Majority of the projects in this directory introduce by [100 Days of Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/). Please Take a look at Angela's courses if you are interested in learning Python. It is really good for some one just start or simply want to consolidate your knowledge
- The other code challenges was from [HackerRank.com](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [AI Academy](https://ai-academy.com/)
